ANT
 ===

Introduction
------------
 Python implementation of the ANT, ANT+, and ANT-FS protocols. For more
 information about ANT, see http://www.thisisant.com/.

 Can be used to communicate with ANT nodes using an ANT stick (USB).
 
 This project came to be when I tried to download data for analysis from my
 ANT+/ANT-FS enabled running watch under GNU/Linux. This eventually lead me to
 attempting to port ANT_LIB and ANT_DLL (by Dynastream) to Linux. However, I
 didn't quite like the library, the protocol is well documented and trivial to
 implement, and I was going to have to write a ctypes-based wrapper afterwards
 since I was only going to use the library from Python. Thus, I decided to
 write a pure Python implementation.
